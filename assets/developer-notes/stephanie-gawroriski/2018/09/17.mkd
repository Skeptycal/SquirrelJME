Well, I am quite sleepy and I literally worked on SquirrelJME all day long so
it was not bad at all. I made a ton of commits which is nice. Things are
getting much further along. Additionally seeing progress is nice, hopefully
next weekend I can actually have printing text and such. Just next weekend
I will be handling `LOOKUPSWITCH` which will be fun.
