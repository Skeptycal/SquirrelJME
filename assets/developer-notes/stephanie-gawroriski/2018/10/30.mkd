I wonder how I am going to handle `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap`, so that
will be a bit of a mystery.

I do not need to worry about the mod count at all for the maps because it is
kept internal. So that means only bucket map needs it. But I guess bucket map
just needs to keep track of it.

Okay, I think I have too many map classes and such, they need to be simplified
much!
