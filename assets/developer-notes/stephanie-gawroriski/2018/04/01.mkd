So commands can have multiple parents. Also for local caching, I think it
would be best to have a single lock which modifies things for each item
to prevent GC from dropping references. I suppose a single lock would be
best so that way things can happen anywhere without there being a giant
mess especially when lists and such are needed to be set.
