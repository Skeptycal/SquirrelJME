Going to skip LCDUI a bit and go back to the layout parser I was working on so
I can get the test projects compiling and such.

For the parser, I am going to do a simple read of the body for an entire class
before going into the parser for it that way I do not need to worry about the
state of it and such. Basically all tokens would be remained within the inner
fragment as it is parsed.
